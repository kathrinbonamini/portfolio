# BOTO3 101
Basic functions to perform operations on AWS S3 via Python SDK (boto3)


```python
import os
import boto3
```

### SET S3 ENPOINTS AND PW
You can either populate .aws/ folder with S3 endpoints or gather them all into a specific file; in the latter case, be sure to add such file into .gitignore, to never ever push it to Git.


```python
SERVICE_NAME = 's3'
BUCKET = "sample-bucket"
REGION = "eu-central-1"
FOLDER = "docs"
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "ABC123"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "abc123efg"
```

### CONNECTORS


```python
def get_s3_client():
    # use to download from s3
    s3_client = boto3.client(
        service_name=SERVICE_NAME,
        region_name=REGION,
        aws_access_key_id=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
        aws_secret_access_key=AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
    return s3_client
```


```python
def get_s3_resource():
    # use to read directly from s3 & upload
    s3_resource = boto3.resource(
        service_name=SERVICE_NAME,
        region_name=REGION,
        aws_access_key_id=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
        aws_secret_access_key=AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
    return s3_resource
```

### UPLOAD LOCAL FILE TO S3


```python
def upload_to_s3(localpath):
    s3_resource = get_s3_resource()
    basename = os.path.basename(localpath)
    dst_file = os.path.join(FOLDER, basename)
    s3_resource.Bucket(BUCKET).upload_file(localpath, dst_file)
```

### DOWNLOAD OBJECT FROM S3


```python
def download_from_s3(obj_name):
    s3_client = get_s3_client()
    localpath = os.path.basename(obj_name)
    s3_client.download_file(BUCKET, obj_name, localpath)
```
